# New RHL Website

This is the future RHL Website.

## Running the site locally

In order to compile the assets and run Jekyll on local you need to follow those steps:

- Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org)
- Install [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
- Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
- Run `npm install`
- linux: Run `sudo npm install -g gulp-cli`
- windows: Run `npm install -g gulp-cli`
- Run `gulp`

To edit css/js edit the files in `src` that are compiled with `gulp`.
